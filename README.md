# Quantum Programming API

This API aims to create an infrastructure where programmers can use the power of quantum systems and quantum algorithms in every day programs. The goal of this project is to eventually have plug-and-play package that allows progammers to easily incorporate real quantum computing power into their projects for mainly experimental purposes.

**NOTE:** This project is in the development stage.

## Installation

We highly recommend using a virtual environment when interacting with the API. You can create, activate, and install the dependencies with the command sequence:

```
python -m venv [environment-name]
source [environment-name]/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip && pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You can then activate and reactivate your environment to your liking with:

```
deactivate
source source [environment-name]/bin/activate
```
