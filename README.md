# Quantum Programming API

Common Q&A:

**NOTE:** This project is in the development stage. Our plans are to provide a plug-and-play API for you to experiment with yourself, but for now we are more focused on developing the API.

## Installation

We highly recommend using a virtual environment when interacting with the API. You can create, activate, and install the dependencies with the command sequence:

```
python -m venv [environment-name]
source [environment-name]/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip && pip install -r requirements.txt
```
